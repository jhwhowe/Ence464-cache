The assignment instructions are [here](https://eng-git.canterbury.ac.nz/mph/ence464-assignment-2018/blob/master/doc/assignment.pdf).

Example test code is
[here](https://eng-git.canterbury.ac.nz/mph/ence464-assignment-2018/blob/master/src/poisson_test.cpp).
You will need to instrument this with timing code.  Note, your
implementation must comply with the prototype defined in
[src/poisson.hpp](https://eng-git.canterbury.ac.nz/mph/ence464-assignment-2018/blob/master/src/poisson.hpp).
